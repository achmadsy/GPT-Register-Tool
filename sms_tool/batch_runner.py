    ``accounts.sqlite3``.  Signing one of those up again cannot succeed -- the
    server answers ``user_already_exists`` -- but the signup lane only learns
    that *after* spending an email OTP on the way to ``/about-you``, so every
    such address is a burned OTP that could never have produced an account.

    Skipping is the default because it cannot lose a signup that would
    otherwise have succeeded.  Set ``registration.skip_registered_mailboxes``

    half-finished account).

    Returns ``(kept, skipped_registered, skipped_dead_end)``.  A lookup failure
    keeps the original list: an unreadable account database must not silently
    empty a batch.

    The two skip reasons are reported separately because they need different
    operator actions.  A ``registered`` row means the account exists in *our*

    taken while we hold no credentials for it -- which is why it is absent from

    that day's 305 ``user_already_exists`` answers, 292 (96%) were aliases whose

    *not* proof: 99 aliases on this install did register successfully against an
    already-occupied base, so dropping them would lose real signups.  They move
    behind the fresh addresses instead, where a scarce worker/proxy slot is
