"""Central logging configuration for ``sms_tool``.

Call :func:`configure_logging` once at process start (CLI entry points such as
``chatgpt_phone_reg.py`` / ``cli``). It installs two size-capped, rotated
handlers under ``runtime/logs/processes/<pid>/`` so Python-side output is observable instead of
being swallowed by the WPF stdout capture:

- ``sms_tool.log`` — the operator log. :class:`HumanLogFormatter` renders one
  normalized line per record (``HH:MM:SS [*] [模块] 消息``), translates
  registration stage records into named phases, and never prints envelope
  metadata (schema_version/command_id/run_id) or raw JSON.
- ``sms_tool.jsonl`` — the machine log. :class:`CorrelatedJsonFormatter` keeps
  the full telemetry envelope for tooling and audits.

The previous state was 534 ``print()`` calls with zero rotation and zero
persistence. The call is idempotent: a second invocation is a no-op.

    writing. Nothing surfaced the stop, because the seven concurrent Python
    processes that had the file open also meant ``sms_tool.1.jsonl`` was never
    created -- there was no rotated file to notice either.

    strictly better than losing the record, and the first failure is announced
